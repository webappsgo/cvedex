# AI Rules (PART 0, 1)

⚠️ **These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Violations are bugs.** ⚠️

## CRITICAL - NEVER DO
- ❌ Guess or assume — READ THE SPEC or ASK
- ❌ Implement without reading relevant PART first
- ❌ Modify AI.md PART content (read-only spec)
- ❌ Add features not in spec without asking
- ❌ Use "I think" or "probably" — KNOW from spec or ASK
- ❌ Ask multiple plain-text questions in separate messages — use AskUserQuestion wizard instead
- ❌ Use generic placeholder content ("Your app name", "Feature 1")
- ❌ Create /server/about or /server/help with placeholder text
- ❌ Leave TODO comments in code — implement fully or do not implement
- ❌ Create stub functions or "future" placeholders
- ❌ Partial implementations — every feature must be 100% complete
- ❌ "I'll come back to this later" — there is no later, do it NOW
- ❌ Add premium/paid feature gates — all features are free
- ❌ Use external cron daemons — built-in scheduler only (PART 19)
- ❌ Use client-side rendering (React, Vue, Angular) — Go templates only

## CRITICAL - ALWAYS DO
- ✅ Read relevant PART before implementing ANY feature
- ✅ Search AI.md before asking questions (answer is likely there)
- ✅ Follow spec EXACTLY — no "improvements" without approval
- ✅ Update IDEA.md when features change
- ✅ Keep all docs in sync with code
- ✅ When unsure, ASK — never guess or assume
- ✅ Use AskUserQuestion wizard — one question at a time, options + custom input
- ✅ Source /server/about and /server/help content from IDEA.md
- ✅ Implement features 100% complete — no stubs, no TODOs, no "future"
- ✅ ONE thing at a time — finish current task completely before starting another

## KEY DECISIONS (pre-answered)
| Question | Answer | Reference |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| What password hash? | Argon2id (NEVER bcrypt) | PART 11 |
| Where is Dockerfile? | `docker/Dockerfile` (NEVER project root) | PART 27 |
| CGO enabled? | NEVER (CGO_ENABLED=0 always) | PART 7 |
| Premium features? | NEVER (all features free) | PART 1 |
| External cron? | NEVER (built-in scheduler) | PART 19 |
| Client-side rendering? | NEVER (server-side Go templates) | PART 16 |
| SQLite driver? | modernc.org/sqlite ONLY (NEVER mattn/go-sqlite3) | PART 10 |
| Token storage? | SHA-256 hash (NEVER plaintext) | PART 11 |

## TERMINOLOGY
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| server | Main binary `cvedex` — runs as service |
| client | CLI binary `cvedex-cli` — REQUIRED, not optional |
| agent | Optional binary `cvedex-agent` |
| Server Admin | App administrator (NOT OS root) |
| Regular User | End-user (PART 34 — OPTIONAL, not implemented by default) |

## COMPLIANCE CHECK
Before completing ANY task:
- [ ] Read relevant PART(s) in AI.md
- [ ] Implementation matches spec EXACTLY
- [ ] No guessing — all decisions from spec
- [ ] Docs updated if code changed
